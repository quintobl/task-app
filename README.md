# Task App

This is a task app created while going through a Udemy course on the most recent features of Angular. The course is called Angular - The Complete Guide (2025 Edition), and it is taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The link to the course on Udemy is here: [The Complete Guide (2025 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/).
The first few commits to this repo consisted of the README.md file, as well as starter files provided by the course instructor.
I will attempt to explain each concept discussed in the course, as well as the code in each commit, in my own words in **_.md_** files in the **_developer-notes_** folder in this repo.
The reason I'm taking this course is two-fold:

1. Keep my knowledge of Angular fresh. There's nothing worse than learning a piece of technology but then forgetting how to use it after not working with it for a period of time.
2. Learn new features of Angular that I haven't used before, such as signals or standalone components.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
